# Digital-logic
this menu-driven app simulates key digital electronics operations. It generates truth tables for 7 logic gates, performs binary arithmetic (addition, 1’s/2’s complement), demonstrates half/full adder circuits, and handles decimal-binary conversions using bitwise operators—ideal for learning digital logic.
